This repository contains work done for Core Lab 2: Spatial, a course in the Art, Media, and Technology program at Parsons Paris, Spring 2017.

The first project, [Inner Space](), focused on capturing and visualizing data from a near space.  Examples of final work and my process can be found on my [New School Portfolio]().
